    <h2>Responsive Sites vs. Mobile Apps</h2>
    <p>Now more than ever, people are choosing to use their smartphones to browse the internet over laptops and desktops. According to Business Insider, 75% of the population worldwide will be connected to the internet via mobile phone by 2020. Most of the web has adapted accordingly using responsive web styles and mobile applications in order to cater to smaller viewports. When creating a site for your business, it is highly important that you consider the range of screen sizes that it could be viewed from. Since smartphones, tablets, and desktop monitors all vary in sizes, using responsive styles ensures that your site looks good no matter what device is being used. Creating a mobile application is also a great way to reach smartphone and tablet users. Whether you should create a mobile app or stick to a responsive website all depends on the content of your site.</p>
<h3>Mobile applications</h3>
    <p>For businesses that require more interaction with their customers, mobile apps provide convenience for users. Apps can be great for businesses that sell certain products or services, giving them an easy way to order right from their phones. They are also much faster and optimized for mobile devices so that the user has a more streamlined experience. </p>
<h3>Responsive sites</h3>
    <p>Responsive styles are great for sites that are more informational. While mobile apps give users more ease of access to your content, they are more costly and it requires a higher skill level to create an app that is polished and professional. While a responsive mobile site may not give you the same speed and functionality as a mobile app, they are still essential in case the user does not have or want to download the app. For businesses that don’t require frequent interaction with their customers and clients, a responsive site is all that is really needed.</p>
